This is Caboodle, a clone of Planarity[1].

Caboodle lived originally in Darcs. This repository doesn't contain
the history of the original Darcs repo, but instead starts from a
snapshot of version 0.5.

I haven't touched Caboodle in well over a decade and I'm not planning to,
so if you feel like doing anything with it, please go ahead and fork.

The objective of the game is to arrange the balls on the screen so that no lines cross.

It is for the GNOME[2] environment. It is written in OCaml[3] using
lablgtk2[4] and cairo-ocaml[5] which in turn use Gtk+[6] and Cairo[7].

The author of this software is Juri Pakaste <juri@iki.fi>, and it is
licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2
or newer. For more information, see COPYING.

To compile and install, run make install in the top level directory.
By default, Caboodle is installed under /usr/local. To install to an 
alternative location, you can define the make variables PREFIX. 

make PREFIX=/opt/caboodle install

If you do not wish for the .desktop file to go under
PREFIX/share/applications, you can define the variable DESKTOPLOCATION
separately.
